## Short Bio

Hi! I'm a web developer living and working in Ontario, Canada.

If you'd like to talk to me about software, music, or anything interesting, drop me a line below!

If you'd like to peruse some of the code I've written, take a look at my [<i class="uk-icon-github"></i> Github Account.](http://github.com/cam5).

## Longer, Third-Person Version

Cameron Hurd is a full-stack web developer, with {{ 'now' | date: '%Y' | minus: 2011 | plus: 1 }} years' formal experience, and several more years worth of failed experiments on the early internet.

He has run a web consultancy called [*Adventurous Web Design*](https://adventurouswebdesign.com/) since 2012. They have been helping businesses leverage web technologies ever since.

Although he is a graduate of the Music Industry Arts program at Fanshawe College, Cameron is a self-taught web developer. To that end, he's invested several hundred hours across [reading](https://www.instapaper.com/p/cameronhurd) and [<i class="uk-icon-stack-overflow"></i> asking & answering all manner of questions](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1779433/cameron-hurd).
