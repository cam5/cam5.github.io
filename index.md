## Short Bio

Hi! I'm a web developer living and working in Ontario, Canada.

If you'd like to talk to me about building websites, music, or something cool that you've read, drop me a line below!

If looking at actual code is your thing, take a look at my [<i class="uk-icon-github"></i> Github Account.](http://github.com/cam5).

## Longer, Third-Person Bio

Cameron Hurd is a full-stack web developer, with {{ 'now' | date: '%Y' | minus: 2011 | plus: 1 }} years' formal experience, and several more years worth of failed experiments on the early internet.

Crafting websites and web applications with equal parts HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Linux and â™¡, he founded a web consultancy called [*Adventurous Web Design*](http://adventurouswebdesign.com/) in 2012. He has been helping small business owners leverage web technologies ever since.

Although he is graduate of the Music Industry Arts program at Fanshawe College, Cameron is a self-taught web developer. Persistence and self-education are two important tools in his repetoire. To that end, he's invested several hundred hours across a variety of topics via books in dead-tree format, [online articles](https://www.instapaper.com/p/cameronhurd), [<i class="uk-icon-code"></i> CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/users/1068085), [<i class="uk-icon-linux"></i> Linux Academy](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/camhurd#certifications), and [<i class="uk-icon-stack-overflow"></i> Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1779433/cameron-hurd).

Cameron makes awful puns as [<i class="uk-icon-twitter"></i> @cameronhurd](http://twitter.com/cameronhurd) on twitter, and can be found now and again in the `#wordpress` channel on Freenode.
