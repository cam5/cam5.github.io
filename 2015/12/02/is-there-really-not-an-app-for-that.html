      <div class="content uk-margin uk-margin-top"><p>When we buy Apple products, the promise is that they will “just work”, and they often make good on that. Most of us treat purchasing a car as a “buy and drive” affair — and that’s usually how the transaction goes. Manufacturing computer hardware or an automobile is a far more complex task than building a website. Why then, is it so hard to make our way online?</p>

<p>Is “easy” too much to hope for?</p>

<p>Marketing messages trumpet simplicity in getting a website up &amp; running<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. But after we buy in, and notice that the proverbial Big Mac<sup>©</sup> on our tray doesn’t match the one on the billboard, we can’t help but feel a little disappointed.</p>

<p>I want to talk about some reasons for the letdown we all feel at some point in the journey of building a website:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When using a page builder app, we often don’t factor in the limitations, or consider what will happen when we outgrow them; this can create a headache when it’s time to move.</li>
  <li>Websites need more than just money - they require mental and emotional resources to fill them with meaningful content (and functions) for our visitors. We often underestimate just how much of those resources we’ll need to provide.</li>
  <li>Tech-jargon gets in the way. The level of effort to create a web-<em>application</em>, versus a web-<em>site</em> is wildly different, but we use “website” as a catch-all term.</li>
</ol>

<p>“But I just need a space online for people to read about me/my company”, you say. “Is there really not an app for this?” If you’re looking for a template, photo gallery, and a contact page, sure: there <strong>are</strong> apps for that!<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> To wit: companies like Squarespace have got your back. GoDaddy is just waiting in the wings for you to ask them. Everyone’s favourite internet titan, Google, even has a site-builder product. They probably offer <em>most</em> of what you’ll need out of the gate.</p>

<p>Using a page-builder to build a website is like leasing space at an office park. Pros: Quick set-up, and competitive prices. Plus, there is a landlord (customer support) to call when things go wrong. Cons: space for growth is limited, and the building policy will someday get in the way of your plans. (“What do you mean, there’s no support for [insert feature here<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>]?”) And the real gumption trap: when you do decide to make the move to a new space, it’s unlikely your digital-furnishings are a 1:1 match for the new space’s floor plan; retrofitting is sometimes as expensive as starting from the ground-up.</p>

<p>Earlier, we used “purchasing a car” as an example of an easy process, relative to purchasing a website. This comparison has some rhetorical value, but a website is more akin to buying a house than a car. A car can be put to use right away, but homeownership calls on us to make a greater number of decisions over a longer period, before our new purchase is ready. Like a home, a website needs us to furnish it (write content), obsess about decoration (branding/design), and fret about how many guests can visit at a time (server resources). The more choices we’re presented with, the less likely we are to characterize the object of those choices as “quick and easy”.</p>

<p>Compounding the expectation for speed that the marketing sets up, we access our digital creations via the internet, which has a reputation for being instant. That reputation tends to rub off on everything the internet associates with. When we complete a site, you can bet it will load fast - it’s just that to reach that stage, we need to invest considerable time and energy.</p>

<p>Finally - we may be describing a web application, but labelling it a website. For the majority of the internet’s short life, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website">description that Wikipedia offers</a> for “website” was accurate (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A website, … is a set of related web <strong>pages</strong> typically served from a single web domain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pages don’t imply much interactivity. However, contrast that with <a href="http://webtrends.about.com/od/webapplications/a/web_application.htm">web application</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A web application … can be as simple as a message board or a guest sign-in book on a website, or as complex as a word processor or a spreadsheet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it seems like we’re splitting hairs, imagine that a website is like creating a graphic for an event, versus a web application: planning and delivering the actual event on the graphic. Two related but fundamentally different concepts.</p>

<p>Graphic design for an event might take place in an office or a study, usually with a relatively limited scope. Planning the event itself requires a team, logistics, and overcoming bureaucratic and political barriers. Success can depend on the whims of a committee, attendees, and maybe even the weather. It’s a bigger undertaking and requires a different skill set to deliver.</p>

<p>Here’s the silver lining, though: if there’s no “app for that”, it’s means your market probably isn’t saturated. If there isn’t a turnkey solution, it’s an indicator that we’re on a frontier. If we need to build something custom, we’re also building a competitive advantage.</p>

<p>If there’s not an app for that, then you have an opportunity to build one.</p>
